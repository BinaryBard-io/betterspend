# BetterSpend System Architecture

## Overview
BetterSpend is a modern procurement system built using the T3 Stack, providing a comprehensive solution for managing purchase requisitions, approvals, and vendor relationships.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **React** for component-based UI development

### Backend
- **tRPC** for end-to-end type safety and API layer
- **NextAuth.js** for authentication and session management
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database operations

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Prisma Migrate** for database schema management

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **pnpm** for package management

## System Components

### Authentication Layer
- NextAuth.js handles user authentication
- Supports multiple providers (Google, Discord, etc.)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Session management with database persistence

### API Layer
- tRPC provides type-safe API endpoints
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Error handling and logging

### Database Layer
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Migrations for schema versioning
- Seed data for development and testing

### Frontend Layer
- Next.js App Router for modern React patterns
- Server and client components for optimal performance
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates using tRPC subscriptions

## Data Flow

### User Authentication
1. User initiates login through NextAuth.js
2. Authentication provider validates credentials
3. Session created and stored in database
4. User role and permissions loaded
5. Access granted to appropriate features

### Requisition Process
1. User creates requisition draft
2. Items added to requisition
3. Requisition submitted for approval
4. Approval workflow triggered
5. Status updates propagated to all stakeholders

### Data Persistence
1. User actions trigger tRPC procedures
2. Input validation performed using Zod
3. Business logic executed in server procedures
4. Database operations performed via Prisma
5. Results returned to client with type safety

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Secure session management
- CSRF protection
- Secure cookie configuration
- Provider-specific security measures

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Route-level protection
- API endpoint authorization
- Data access restrictions

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- XSS protection through React
- Secure environment variable handling

## Scalability Considerations

### Database
- Proper indexing for performance
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Migration strategies

### Application
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Static generation where appropriate
- Caching strategies
- CDN integration for assets

### Infrastructure
- Containerization with Docker
- Load balancing capabilities
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and recovery procedures
